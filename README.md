The Piano App

Instead of just being a normal piano app this app can help naive or casual paino learners to learn and practice the notes.

This app have the feature of extracting notes from monophonic piano tunes using 
fast fourier transfrom.

I am thinking of implementing it with the help of google magenta onsets and frames for better accuracy

https://magenta.tensorflow.org/onsets-frames

but first this issue need to be resolved
